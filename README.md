<h1>Port Scanner using Python3</h1>

<p>
I'm excited to introduce my first cybersecurity project: a port scanner!

This tool was developed while attending TCM Security Academy's Ethical Hacking course. As I strive to become a proficient security analyst, I believe understanding offensive security techniques is crucial for effective defense and data/infrastructure security. I plan to continue refining and expanding the capabilities of this tool in the future.
